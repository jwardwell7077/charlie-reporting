## 📋 **PHASE 2.5 EXECUTION PLAN (If Desired)**

### **Day 1: Testing Foundation**

```bash
# Install missing dependencies
pip install pytest-cov pytest-asyncio httpx pytest-mock

# Update pytest.ini for coverage
# Create service-specific test migration
# Establish baseline coverage metrics
```text

### **Day 2: API Implementation**

```python
# Implement health endpoints for all services
# Create basic business logic APIs
# Add HTTP client framework for inter-service communication
# Basic API documentation generation
```text

### **Day 3: Integration & Validation**

```python
# End-to-end workflow testing
# Performance baseline establishment
# Complete Phase 2 validation (target: 85%+ completion)
# Documentation updates
```text
