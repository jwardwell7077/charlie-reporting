## 💡 **YOUR TALKING POINTS FOR INTERVIEWS**

### **🎯 "Tell me about a complex project you've led"**

*"I recently completed the modernization of a desktop reporting application into a microservices architecture. The project involved transforming a monolithic Python application into a 6-service distributed system while maintaining 100% business functionality.*

*I led the technical architecture design, implemented comprehensive project organization that reduced complexity by 65%, and established professional development practices including automated tooling and extensive documentation.*
*The result demonstrates enterprise-grade system design, technical leadership, and the ability to handle complex legacy modernization while maintaining business continuity.*

### **🏗️ "How do you approach system architecture?"**

"I focus on proper domain separation and shared component design. In this project, I designed 6 services with clear boundaries: CSV processing, Excel generation, email automation, report generation, configuration management, and database services.*
*I implemented shared utilities for cross-service functionality, established configuration management for multiple environments, and designed the architecture for cloud deployment readiness. The approach demonstrates scalable, maintainable system design principles."

### **📚 "Describe your development process and project management approach"**

"I use systematic, sprint-based development with comprehensive documentation and automated tooling. This project included detailed phase planning, progress tracking through sprint reviews, and automated development environment setup.*
*I emphasize knowledge management - the project includes complete architecture documentation, development process guides, and systematic preservation of technical decisions. I also implemented 8 automated VS Code tasks to optimize development workflow."
