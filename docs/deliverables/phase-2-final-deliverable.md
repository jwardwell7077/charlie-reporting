## üí° **INTERVIEW QUESTION PREPARATION**

### "Tell me about a complex project you've worked on"

"I recently completed the modernization of a desktop reporting application into a microservices architecture. The project involved migrating from a monolithic Python script to a 5-service distributed system while maintaining 100% functional compatibility. I led the technical planning, implemented enterprise-grade project organization, and established comprehensive documentation and development processes. The result was a 65% reduction in project complexity while creating a foundation for cloud deployment."

### "How do you approach legacy system modernization?"

"I use a systematic phase-based approach. First, I conduct comprehensive analysis and planning with detailed documentation. Then I implement organization and structural improvements while preserving existing functionality. I establish automated tooling and testing frameworks to ensure reliability during migration. Finally, I create clear migration paths for future enhancements. In my recent project, this approach allowed me to transform a complex desktop application while maintaining complete business continuity."

### "Describe your development process and project management approach"

"I use sprint-based development with comprehensive documentation and automated validation. Each phase includes detailed planning, implementation tracking, and thorough review processes. I emphasize automated tooling to ensure consistency and establish clear metrics for progress tracking. My recent project included 8 automated development tasks, comprehensive sprint reviews, and systematic archive management to preserve development knowledge."
