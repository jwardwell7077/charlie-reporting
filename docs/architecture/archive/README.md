# Archive (Legacy Microservice Docs)

This directory holds deprecated microservice-era design artifacts for historical reference only.

Active project = lean modular monolith. Do NOT update or depend on these files for current engineering decisions.

Retained files:

- api_framework.md
- email_service_design.md
- tdd-optimized-architecture.md
- PATHLIB_MIGRATION.md

If material here becomes relevant again, extract only the minimal necessary concepts into a new concise doc under `docs/` and leave the rest archived.

You may delete this entire folder once core monolith features (ingestion_log, run_history, scheduler, daily aggregation, email packaging) are implemented and stable.
