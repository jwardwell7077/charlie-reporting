## ðŸŽ¯ **Architecture Principles**

### **1. Plan and Architect Before Implement**

- All architectural changes must be documented before implementation
- Design decisions require written justification and alternatives analysis
- Implementation follows approved architectural blueprints

### **2. Test-First Design**

- Every component designed with testability as primary concern
- Clear separation between testable business logic and infrastructure
- Dependency injection enables easy mocking and isolation
