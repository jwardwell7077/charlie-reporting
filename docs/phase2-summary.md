# Historical Phase 2 Summary

Earlier iteration delivered a multi-service prototype (database, email, scheduler, outlook relay, report generator) with high test coverage and formal architecture. The reset intentionally narrowed scope to accelerate value delivery.

Carried Forward Lessons:

| Theme | Lesson | Applied Now |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Over-segmentation | Microservices added overhead early | Monolith with clean modules |
| Interfaces | Premature abstraction cost | Only abstract likely variants |
| Testing | Contract + integration balance | Minimal yet meaningful coverage |
| Tooling | Consistent lint/type enabled safe deletions | Keep lean pyproject + ruff/mypy |
| Config | Simple TOML sufficient | Avoid deep nesting |

Why Reset:

- Scope: single reporting pipeline.
- Simplicity: faster onboarding & iteration.
- Focus: reduce cognitive load.

Forward Focus:

1. Idempotent ingestion + file tracking.
2. Scheduler (hourly + quad-daily).
3. Email packaging & send.
4. Real SharePoint sync.
5. Metrics & lightweight auth (if needed).

Portfolio Note: Demonstrates ability to scale up (previous architecture) and to pragmatically scale down when ROI declines.
