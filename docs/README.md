# Documentation Index (Lean Monolith – Aug 2025)

This directory now reflects the trimmed, restart-focused project. Most verbose microservice-era docs were archived or removed; only concise, high-signal references remain.

## Core Living Docs

| Purpose | File |
|---------|------|
| (Removed) historical phase summary | Deleted (git history) |
| Current architecture & roadmap | `foundation-overview.md` |
| API surface (MVP) | `api_overview.md` |
| Testing strategy | `testing-approach.md` |

## Historical (Kept Brief)

| Context | Where |
|---------|-------|
| Development diary (detailed history – may prune later) | `development-diary.md` |
| (Removed) Product delivery snapshot | Deleted (git history) |
| (Removed) Cleanup snapshot | Deleted (git history) |

## Editing Guidelines

1. Keep new docs under ~150 lines unless reference material.
2. Prefer updating existing summaries over adding new files.
3. Delete superseded docs immediately after creating a replacement summary.

## Next Possible Doc Improvements (Optional)

- Collapse `development-diary.md` into a shorter "history.md".
- Add/refresh `OPERATIONS.md` once scheduler + email sending implemented.

If a file here feels like narrative rather than enabling action, consider pruning or summarizing it.
