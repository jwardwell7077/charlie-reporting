"""Backward compatibility shim for legacy import path.

The domain models were migrated to ``src/domain/models``. Older code (or
inâ€‘flight branches) may still import from
``business.models.attachment``. This module re-exports the new
Pydantic model so those imports continue to function while the codebase
is refactored.
