- [ ] **TDD Implementation**: Complete red-green-refactor cycle documentation
- [ ] **Dependency Injection**: 100% of external dependencies injected
- [ ] **Interface Contracts**: All service boundaries defined by interfaces
- [ ] **Working CI/CD**: Automated test execution and coverage reporting

### **Quality Gates**

## 🏗️ **Implementation Plan**

### **Target Service**: `report-generator`

**Selected Because**:

- Clear scope and well-defined boundaries
- Existing Pydantic schemas provide foundation
- Business value for email report processing
- Manageable complexity for complete TDD implementation

### **TDD Implementation Phases**

#### **Phase A: Test Infrastructure Setup**

- [ ] Create pytest configuration with coverage reporting
- [ ] Set up test directory structure following TDD patterns
- [ ] Create mock factories and test utilities
- [ ] Establish CI/CD integration with automated testing

#### **Phase B: Interface Definition**

- [ ] Define core service interfaces (`IReportGenerator`, `IDirectoryProcessor`)
- [ ] Create dependency interfaces (`IFileSystem`, `ILogger`, `IConfig`)
- [ ] Establish contract definitions with type hints
- [ ] Document interface responsibilities and contracts

#### **Phase C: TDD Implementation Cycles**

**Cycle 1: Core Report Generation**

- [ ] RED: Write failing tests for basic report generation
- [ ] GREEN: Implement minimal code to pass tests
- [ ] REFACTOR: Extract dependencies and improve design

**Cycle 2: Directory Processing**

- [ ] RED: Write failing tests for directory scanning and processing
- [ ] GREEN: Implement directory processing logic
- [ ] REFACTOR: Optimize performance and maintainability

**Cycle 3: Configuration Management**

- [ ] RED: Write failing tests for configuration loading and validation
- [ ] GREEN: Implement configuration management
- [ ] REFACTOR: Ensure dependency injection throughout

**Cycle 4: Error Handling & Edge Cases**

- [ ] RED: Write failing tests for error scenarios
- [ ] GREEN: Implement robust error handling
- [ ] REFACTOR: Consolidate error patterns

#### **Phase D: Integration & Validation**

- [ ] Integration testing with real file system
- [ ] Performance benchmarking and optimization
- [ ] Documentation completion
- [ ] Final coverage analysis and reporting
